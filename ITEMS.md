# IOTMs and Useful Items used by Garbo

In an ideal world, Garbo is supposed to be a flexible script that operates successfully for users regardless of their existing IOTM loadout. While Garbo has -support- for quite a lot of IOTMs, it doesn't really -require- any of them -- Garbo will do its best to make you as much meat as possible given the resources available to you. All that said, there are a few (relatively) cheap items that Garbo uses that can be useful to pick up. While Garbo does buy things like your diet & your potions, these are items where Garbo will not purchase them itself (as they don't pay for themselves in one distinct session of Garbo), but do make Garbo better enough to be worth looking into acquiring.

## "Cheap" items worth acquiring (<10 million)

Those are our best recommendations for a handful of relatively cheap things Garbo uses that you may want to look into purchasing, as they effectively pay for themselves. This next table outlines something a bit different -- tradable IOTMs that are commonly availabe in a communal clan stash, but are (almost certainly) not worth purchasing for solo use. If you don't have access to them, that's totally fine -- Garbo will, again, do its best! But if you have any access to possible stash clans, you should make sure your stash clan preferences are set properly so that Garbo can utilize these tradeable tools for profit and value.

Having gone through tradeable things and cheap purchases, the rest of this list is devoted to bind-to-account IOTMs that Garbo utilizes for farming.

:warning: **DISCLAIMER: Nothing on this list is required or is particularly worth buying for farming.** :warning:

Let me say that again -- **NOTHING ON THIS LIST IS REQUIRED**. Depending on your KOL goals, some of these may be useful to you in the context of speed ascension or other fun in-game goals, so we certainly encourage you to buy things that will make your KOL experience more fun. But from a pure farming perspective, even the most helpful items on this list are so expensive that they will not pay for themselves in any reasonable payoff calendar.

Let's take, for example, the best farming item in KOL history -- the Robortender. At writing, the Robortender can be had for 750 million meat. Having a Robortender will make you (approximately) 300,000 more meat per day over someone whose best meat drop familiar is a Hobo Monkey. That's quite a lot, and (again) is by a pretty considerable margin the best farming item in the game. But at a price like 750 million, the time it would take to recoup your investment from Barf farming is absolutely ridiculous. It would take you a startling **2,500** days of farming to recoup that expenditure -- seven years straight of your KOL account doing nothing but farming. _Jeez._

So, to reiterate: please, _do not_ take this as a "suggested IOTMs to buy" list. This is simply a list of what Garbo supports. If you have an IOTM that is not included in this list, but you think it -should-, let us know in the #garbage-collector channel on the ASS Discord, and we can walk you through the process of submitting a pull request. Thank you for reading, and happy garbage farming!
