# IOTMs and Useful Items used by Garbo

In an ideal world, Garbo is supposed to be a flexible script that operates successfully for users regardless of their existing IOTM loadout. While Garbo has -support- for quite a lot of IOTMs, it doesn't really -require- any of them -- Garbo will do its best to make you as much meat as possible given the resources available to you. All that said, there are a few (relatively) cheap items that Garbo uses that can be useful to pick up. While Garbo does buy things like your diet & your potions, these are items where Garbo will not purchase them itself (as they don't pay for themselves in one distinct session of Garbo), but do make Garbo better enough to be worth looking into acquiring.

## "Cheap" items worth acquiring (<10 million)

| Item                                           | Type      | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mafia pointer finger ring                      | Accessory | Gain meat on critical hits. Bad for embezzlers, but generally worn rest of the Barf day. The easiest way to make use of it is to go Seal Clubber for access to Furious Wallop - a guaranteed critical hit skill. It is worth noting that unlike most of these items, this often peaks a little over 10 million; this is unfortunate, but this is one of the most valuable individual things you can buy to improve your take, so we must suggest it here. (And note that as an unbound item, you can sell it when you're done with it! Garbo also supports using pointer finger from a stash clan, so if you and your buddies want to share one, make a clan with an in-joke name and go nuts.) |
| lucky gold ring                                | Accessory | Piraterealm reward. Extra funfunds & Freddies; very high MPA accessory.                                                                                                                                           |
| Mr. Cheeng's Spectacles                        | Accessory | That 70s Volcano reward. Drops random potions; many are cheap, but some are quite high value.                                                                                                                    |

Those are our best recommendations for a handful of relatively cheap things Garbo uses that you may want to look into purchasing, as they effectively pay for themselves.

It's entirely possible to mount a respectable setup using just these items and relevant permanent skills, as shown in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19BvfkftgcgBHDVqllMRaCPvoGeys0tSke51VBH2bjiw/edit#gid=217654304). You are assumed to be a Seal Clubber, for Furious Wallop critical hits, in possession of Transcendent Olfaction and all relevant +meat% and +item% skills made permanent, and sporting a number of the gear options outlined above. This results in 3,600 MPA, which is preferable to Volcano farming. Adding a solitary IotM in SongBoom Boombox to this setup upgrades the MPA to 4,000. If you are a very low-IOTM player, please feel free to make a copy of this sheet and try to assess whether you can successfully run Garbo with your loadout.

It is worth noting that, despite this, Garbo is not for everybody. Volcano farming produces an MPA of 3,400, which is less than than the no-IOTM MPA on the sheet above, but more than the MPA you'll get if you remove some of the big pieces of the sheet (like Hobo Monkey). The reason that folks tend to still recommend Garbo is that Garbo is a very expansive script that gets better every single shiny you have. Almost every IOTM gets eventually used for -something- in Garbo, and as a result, as you start generating enough meat to buy shiny toys from Mr. Store, your MPA will naturally get higher and you will eventually dwarf the high floor of Volcano farming. Also, it is worth noting that Volcano daypasses are much, much more expensive than Dinseylandfill passes, so you end up still breaking positive with Garbo over Volcano down to something along the lines of 3,200 or 3,100 MPA. Still, this is an important piece of math to do to figure out your own situation. Good luck!

This next table outlines something a bit different -- tradable IOTMs that are commonly availabe in a communal clan stash, but are (almost certainly) not worth purchasing for solo use. If you don't have access to them, that's totally fine -- Garbo will, again, do its best! But if you have any access to possible stash clans, you should make sure your stash clan preferences are set properly so that Garbo can utilize these tradeable tools for profit and value.

Having gone through tradeable things and cheap purchases, the rest of this list is devoted to bind-to-account IOTMs that Garbo utilizes for farming.

:warning: **DISCLAIMER: Nothing on this list is required or is particularly worth buying for farming.** :warning:

Let me say that again -- **NOTHING ON THIS LIST IS REQUIRED**. Depending on your KOL goals, some of these may be useful to you in the context of speed ascension or other fun in-game goals, so we certainly encourage you to buy things that will make your KOL experience more fun. But from a pure farming perspective, even the most helpful items on this list are so expensive that they will not pay for themselves in any reasonable payoff calendar.

Let's take, for example, the best farming item in KOL history -- the Robortender. At writing, the Robortender can be had for 990 million meat. Having a Robortender will make you (approximately) 300,000 more meat per day over someone whose best meat drop familiar is a Hobo Monkey. That's quite a lot, and (again) is by a pretty considerable margin the best farming item in the game. But at a price like 990 million, the time it would take to recoup your investment from Barf farming is absolutely ridiculous. It would take you a startling **3,300** days of farming to recoup that expenditure -- nine years straight of your KOL account doing nothing but farming. _Jeez._

So, to reiterate: please, _do not_ take this as a "suggested IOTMs to buy" list. This is simply a very rough, incomplete list of what Garbo supports. If you have an IOTM that is not included in this list, but you think it -should-, let us know in the #garbage-collector channel on the ASS Discord, and we can walk you through the process of submitting a pull request. Thank you for reading, and happy garbage farming!
